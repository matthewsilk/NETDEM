# NETDEM
Code for NETDEM MSCA project

### **SimulationsCode**
This directory contains initial development code for the genNetDem R package and various example scripts testing workflows for its use and integrating it with Nimble code fitting hidden Markov Models

### **genNetDem**
This directory contains the initial version of the genNetDem R package. genNetDem is  used to generate longitudinal social network and/or capture-recapture datasets with known underlying properties. The package is fully documented and includes vignettes that provide an overview of different workflows that are possible. Due to installation issues from this repository, the maintained repository for **genNetDem** has been moved to https://github.com/NETDEM-project/genNetDem. The version here will remain, but only as the initial version of the package, and will not be maintained or updated.
